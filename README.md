# Intro to Loops

## Objectives

- Explain some benefits of loops
- Construct a FOR loop
  - List the 4 parts of a FOR loop
  - Loop through an array of values
  - Loop through an array of objects

- STRETCH: Use conditional logic in a loop

## Notes

- Explain some benefits of loops
  * Do the same problem over and over again until we hit the exit condition
  * Good for repetitive tasks!!!
  * Recyclable, Reusable
  * Ex. Security => trying to crack a passcode (brute force)
  * DRY = Don't Repeat Yourself
  * Makes our code more dynamic and flexible

- Construct a FOR loop
  * List the 4 parts of a FOR loop
    - _Initializer_ => the starting point of the loop
    - _Condition_ => gets checked BEFORE each run of the loop
    - _Final Expression_ => last part of the loop; code that runs AFTER each run of the loop completes
    - _Statement_ => what's executed inside the loop (the code that runs)
